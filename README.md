# Crime Management System

The Crime Management System is a Java-based application utilizing Hibernate for optimized database interactions. Focused on simplicity and effectiveness, the system incorporates four primary entity classes: Officer, Suspect, Victim, and Case.

The Officer class encapsulates essential details about law enforcement personnel, while the Suspect and Victim classes store information pertaining to potential offenders and crime victims, respectively. The Case class manages the intricate details of criminal cases, including evidence, status, and relevant updates.

The integration of Hibernate ensures a smooth and secure interaction between the Java application and the underlying database, simplifying data management and retrieval. The project welcomes contributors to enhance these entity classes, adhering to Java and Hibernate best practices.
